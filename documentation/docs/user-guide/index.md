## Choosing an Approach

| Approach | Best For |
|----------|----------|
| **REST API** | Web applications, microservices, language-agnostic clients |
| **Python Library** | Direct integration, scripts, notebooks, batch processing |

Both approaches use the same underlying algorithms and database, so you can mix them as needed.
